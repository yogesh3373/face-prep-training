        <p><b>MongoDB</b> is a NoSQL DBMS where data is stored in the form of documents having <strong>key-value
                pairs</strong> similar to JSON objects. MongoDB enables users<i> to create databases, schemas, and
                tables.</i> It offers the Mongo shell that provides a JS interface for deleting, querying, and updating
            the records.<strong>ExpressJS</strong> is a NodeJS framework that <em>simplifies writing the backend
                code.</em> It saves you from creating multiple Node modules. For keeping the code precise,
            <small>ExpressJS offers a range of middleware.</small><b>ReactJS</b> is a JS library that allows the
            development of <del>user interfaces for mobile apps and SPAs.</del> It allows you to code <sup>JavaScript
                and develop UI components.</sup> The JS library uses <sub>virtual DOM for doing
                everything</sub>.<ins><b>NodeJS</b> is an open-source JavaScript runtime environment that allows users to run
                code on the server. It comes with the node package manager or npm, enabling users to select from a wide
                selection of node modules or packages. Being developed on the Chrome JavaScript Engine enables Node to
                execute code faster.</ins><mark>There are many good reasons to use the MERN Stack. For example, it allows the creation of a 3-tier architecture that includes frontend, backend, and database using JavaScript and JSON.</mark>
